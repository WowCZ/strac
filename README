==================================================================

If you are reading this you have probably already downloaded the PyDial repo but if
you havent, do it now:

> git clone https://github.com/WowCZ/strac.git
> cd strac

PyDial uses Python 2.7 and has not been tested with other versions. Ensure 
that you use the requirements.txt file to install the appropriate dependencies
via pip. If you do not have pip installed yet first do

> sudo easy_install pip

otherwise exectued directly

> pip install -r requirements.txt

Finally, install the documentation

> sh createDocs.sh

Then point your browser at documentation/Docs/index.html.  If PyDial is new to you,
read the Tutorial "Introduction to PyDial".

==================================================================
If you want to train the dialogue policy STRAC-S on each single domain, there are two ways to do this.

(1) You can reduce three training threads into one, which can be implemented at line 872 of 'pydial.py'. Then you can train STRAC-S with

> python pydial.py parallelTrain parallelConfig/strac/env1-maa2c-CR.cfg --seed=0

(2) This is a easier way to train STRAC-S than method (1). You can directly use

> python pydial.py parallelTrain parallelConfig/strac/env1-maa2c-CR.cfg parallelConfig/strac/env1-maa2c-CR.cfg parallelConfig/strac/env1-maa2c-CR.cfg --seed=0,

which is nearly equal to method (1) with three times of batch size.

==================================================================
If you want to train the dialogue policy STRAC-M, please refer to

> python pydial.py parallelTrain parallelConfig/strac/env1-maa2c-CR.cfg parallelConfig/strac/env1-maa2c-SFR.cfg parallelConfig/strac/env1-maa2c-LAP.cfg --seed=0
